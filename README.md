# xBGAS-Minutes


====== 12.1.2017 ======

Updates:
1. Discussed the implementation of extended instructions in the RISC-V spike simulator.
2. Discussed the method to simulate the message passing between multiple nodes. (MPI will be used)
3. Discussed the way to enable the xBGAS extention in spike. (Passing the option through getopt() in spike)
4. Discussed the updates in RISC-V workshop and the possible FPGA devices for the second phase implementations. 

Todo:
1. Keep working on impleemtation of extended instructions in Spike
2. Dive into the code of RISC-V GNU assembler to generate the binaries for Spike.
3. Go through the talks of the 7th RISC-V workshop.
